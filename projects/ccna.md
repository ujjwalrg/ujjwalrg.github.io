## Networking Project

The above diagram is the network project that I've been working on in the spare time. 
The application that I'm using to build and test network components is the cisco packet tracer.
The packet tracer allows simulation of network connection to design and implement the network
topology based on the requirement. The network topology consists of routers, switches, and
servers that are communicating with each other. There are many servers where each has distinct 
functions such as DNS, Syslog, DHCP, etc. Routers implement OSPF routing protocols that allow 
devices on different networks to communicate with each other.
