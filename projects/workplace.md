I work as a NOC technician at Hawaii Pacific Teleport for five years. The teleport is an international provider of satellite and fiber-based communications. Our primary task is to maintain the contracted levels of RF/IF and IP/Terrestrial services to our customers. The working team is responsible for the teleport's operation and maintenance, including everything from the antenna to the customer racks.


### Work Description
In five years, I've leveled up my experience in monitoring RF service levels and taking essential measures to ensure the contracted level's maintenance. Day to day operations include working with customers in the configuration and troubleshooting of their equipment, documentation of accurate information in the databases used in operations, using test measurement and diagnostic equipment to analyze/document/restore services, configuration/troubleshooting of various satellite equipment such as Antenna's LNA's/LNB's/HPA's/Switches, and operation of M&C and security systems.
