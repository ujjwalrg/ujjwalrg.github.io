      Before joining the ICS-314 class at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, I was familiar with the Java programming language. Learning Java, in the beginning, had been a nightmare for me as I was struggling to grasp the concept of the basic jargon such as classes, interfaces, access modifiers, etc. Understanding when and where to use these keywords took me a generous amount of time. While I’m glad that I picked Java as the first programming language, there is no denying that it can get pretty overwhelming at times. Nonetheless, it will help to create a solid foundation to learn other languages.
     Javascript is one of the most popular programming languages that is used extensively for web development. Even though it is getting popular for backend development with the integration of its backend runtime environment like node.js, it’s considered a go-to language for the front end.  Javascript, in comparison to Java, is simple and easy to understand. One prominent example to illustrate the simplicity of Javascript is the creation of the objects without creating classes and instantiating them. Unlike Java, we can write and run code in Javascript without creating classes. Javascript also provides leniency while declaring variables and creating functions, while in Java, we have to strictly specify the type of variables and return types in functions. 
       Javascript is an instrumental language for software development. With the integration of its frameworks such as Angular, Node JS, Electron, etc., we can create web, cross-platform mobile, and desktop applications, and so many other things.
