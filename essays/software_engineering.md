## My Pathway to programming

Like many other students, I switched majors to computer science. I was pursuing an undergraduate degree in Nutrition, and after halfway through my graduation, I decided to change major to become an electrical engineer. Soon after that, I immigrated to the US and started taking Natural Science courses at KCC. I wanted to become an electrical engineer because I enjoy learning physics since I was a kid. As I was working on my associate degree, I passed my classes with satisfactory grades. In my sophomore year at KCC, I took an EE-160 class to learn my first ever programming language. I quickly realized my desire to learn programming outweighed the desire to become an electrical engineer. I was in a great dilemma to decide whether to choose EE or ICS, so I took a break from college to realize my true passion. During my break from college, I started learning networking fundamentals and basic HTML. It interests me, so I decided to switch majors to computer science after receiving my associate degree in natural science.


      

### Early Days

   Choosing the academic major in computer science is one of the best decisions I’ve made in my life. I took ICS111 class at KCC, where I learned about the Java programming language. That class helped me learn about programming fundamentals and object-oriented language. In the subsequent ICS211 class, I started getting exposed to advanced programming concepts and enjoyed learning those. I found many Java keywords ambiguous in the beginning semester, but I learned about the use and importance of those keywords over time.  

### What I Like About This Subject

 When I program and successfully compile my code, I get internal satisfaction, which I never found out before.  I often get amazed by the rapidly evolving technology and always wanted to be a part of it. I’m thankful for choosing computer science because, despite the difficulty, I find every subjects equally motivating. I hope to learn as much as possible to apply my knowledge in real life, whether at work or any project.
